# Unity-wwise-gitignore
Hello everyone, this is a custom code block .gitignore I made for Wwise, unity &amp; GitHub. 
Copy paste the code block into your '.gitignore' file within your unity project. 
By ignoring these files, Git will not track them or include them in your commits.
This will help reduce the size of your repository, make Git operations faster and make your repo look less annoying. 
You can choose what you want to omit or keep from the code block
